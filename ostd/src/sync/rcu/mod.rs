/// Read-Copy Update Synchronization Mechanism
///
/// # Overview
///
/// RCU avoids the use of lock primitives lock primitives while multiple threads
/// concurrently read and update elements that are linked through pointers and that
/// belong to shared data structures.
///
/// Whenever a thread is inserting or deleting elements of data structures in shared
/// memory, all readers are guaranteed to see and traverse either the older or the
/// new structure, therefore avoiding inconsistencies and allowing readers to not be
/// blocked by writers.
///
/// The type parameter `P` represents the data that this rcu is protecting. The type
/// parameter `P` must implement [`OwnerPtr`].
///
/// # Usage
///
/// It is used when performance of reads is crucial and is an example of spaceâ€“time
/// tradeoff, enabling fast operations at the cost of more space.
///
/// Use [`Rcu`] in scenarios that require frequent reads and infrequent
/// updates (read-mostly).
///
/// Use [`Rcu`] in scenarios that require high real-time reading.
///
/// Rcu should not to be used in the scenarios that write-mostly and which need
/// consistent data.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use aster_frame::sync::{Rcu, RcuReadGuard, RcuReclaimer};
///
/// let rcu = Rcu::new(Box::new(42));
///
/// // Read the data protected by rcu
/// {
///     let rcu_guard = rcu.get();
///     assert_eq!(*rcu_guard, 42);
/// }
///
/// // Update the data protected by rcu
/// {
///     let reclaimer = rcu.replace(Box::new(43));
///
///     let rcu_guard = rcu.get();
///     assert_eq!(*rcu_guard, 43);
/// }
