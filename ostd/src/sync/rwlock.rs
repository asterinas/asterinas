/// Spin-based Read-write Lock
///
/// # Overview
///
/// This lock allows for multiple readers, or at most one writer to access
/// at any point in time. The writer of this lock has exclusive access to
/// modify the underlying data, while the readers are allowed shared and
/// read-only access.
///
/// The writing and reading portions cannot be active simultaneously, when
/// one portion is in progress, the other portion will spin-wait. This is
/// suitable for scenarios where the lock is expected to be held for short
/// periods of time, and the overhead of context switching is higher than
/// the cost of spinning.
///
/// The lock provides methods to safely acquire locks with interrupts
/// disabled, preventing deadlocks in scenarios where locks are used within
/// interrupt handlers.
///
/// In addition to traditional read and write locks, this implementation
/// provides the upgradeable read lock (`upread lock`). The `upread lock`
/// can be upgraded to write locks atomically, useful in scenarios
/// where a decision to write is made after reading.
///
/// The type parameter `T` represents the data that this lock is protecting.
/// It is necessary for `T` to satisfy [`Send`] to be shared across tasks and
/// [`Sync`] to permit concurrent access via readers. The [`Deref`] method (and
/// [`DerefMut`] for the writer) is implemented for the RAII guards returned
/// by the locking methods, which allows for the access to the protected data
/// while the lock is held.
///
/// # Usage
/// The lock can be used in scenarios where data needs to be read frequently
/// but written to occasionally.
///
/// Use `upread lock` in scenarios where related checking is performed before
/// modification to effectively avoid deadlocks and improve efficiency.
///
/// This lock should not be used in scenarios where lock-holding times are
/// long as it can lead to CPU resource wastage due to spinning.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Use interrupt-disabled version methods when dealing with interrupt-related read-write locks,
///  as nested interrupts may lead to a deadlock if not properly handled.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use ostd::sync::RwLock;
///
/// let lock = RwLock::new(5)
///
/// // many read locks can be held at once
/// {
///     let r1 = lock.read();
///     let r2 = lock.read();
///     assert_eq!(*r1, 5);
///     assert_eq!(*r2, 5);
///     
///     // Upgradeable read lock can share access to data with read locks
///     let r3 = lock.upread();
///     assert_eq!(*r3, 5);
///     drop(r1);
///     drop(r2);
///     // read locks are dropped at this point
///
///     // An upread lock can only be upgraded successfully after all the
///     // read locks are released, otherwise it will spin-wait.
///     let mut w1 = r3.upgrade();
///     *w1 += 1;
///     assert_eq!(*w1, 6);
/// }   // upread lock are dropped at this point
///
/// {   
///     // Only one write lock can be held at a time
///     let mut w2 = lock.write();
///     *w2 += 1;
///     assert_eq!(*w2, 7);
/// }   // write lock is dropped at this point
