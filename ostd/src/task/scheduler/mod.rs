//! Task scheduling.
//!
//! # Scheduler Injection
//!
//! The task scheduler of an OS is a complex beast,
//! and the most suitable scheduling algorithm often depends on the target usage scenario.
//! To avoid code bloat and offer flexibility,
//! OSTD does not include a gigantic, one-size-fits-all task scheduler.
//! Instead, it allows the client to implement a custom scheduler (in safe Rust, of course)
//! and register it with OSTD.
//! This feature is known as **scheduler injection**.
//!
//! The client kernel performs scheduler injection via the [`inject_scheduler`] API.
//! This API should be called as early as possible during kernel initialization,
//! before any [`Task`]-related APIs are used.
//! This requirement is reasonable since `Task`s depend on the scheduler.
//!
//! # Scheduler Abstraction
//!
//! The `inject_scheduler` API accepts an object implementing the [`Scheduler`] trait,
//! which abstracts over any SMP-aware task scheduler.
//! Whenever an OSTD client spawns a new task (via [`crate::task::TaskOptions`])
//! or wakes a sleeping task (e.g., via [`crate::sync::Waker`]),
//! OSTD internally forwards the corresponding `Arc<Task>`
//! to the scheduler by invoking the [`Scheduler::enqueue`] method.
//! This allows the injected scheduler to manage all runnable tasks.
//!
//! Each enqueued task is dispatched to one of the per-CPU local runqueues,
//! which manage all runnable tasks on a specific CPU.
//! A local runqueue is abstracted by the [`LocalRunQueue`] trait.
//! OSTD accesses the local runqueue of the current CPU
//! via [`Scheduler::local_rq_with`] or [`Scheduler::mut_local_rq_with`],
//! which return immutable and mutable references to `dyn LocalRunQueue`, respectively.
//!
//! The [`LocalRunQueue`] trait enables OSTD to inspect and manipulate local runqueues.
//! For instance, OSTD invokes the [`LocalRunQueue::pick_next`] method
//! to let the scheduler select the next task to run.
//! OSTD then performs a context switch to that task,
//! which becomes the _current_ running task, accessible via [`LocalRunQueue::current`].
//! When the current task is about to sleep (e.g., via [`crate::sync::Waiter`]),
//! OSTD removes it from the local runqueue using [`LocalRunQueue::dequeue_current`].
//!
//! The interfaces of `Scheduler` and `LocalRunQueue` are simple
//! yet (perhaps surprisingly) powerful enough to support
//! even complex and advanced task scheduler implementations.
//! Scheduler implementations are free to employ any load-balancing strategy
//! to dispatch enqueued tasks across local runqueues,
//! and each local runqueue is free to choose any prioritization strategy
//! for selecting the next task to run.
//! Based on OSTD's scheduling abstractions,
//! the Asterinas kernel has successfully supported multiple Linux scheduling classes,
//! including both real-time and normal policies.
//!
//! # Safety Impact
//!
//! While OSTD delegates scheduling decisions to the injected task scheduler,
//! it verifies these decisions to avoid undefined behavior.
//! In particular, it enforces the following safety invariant:
//!
//! > A task must not be scheduled to run on more than one CPU at a time.
//!
//! Violating this invariant—e.g., running the same task on two CPUs concurrently—
//! can have catastrophic consequences,
//! as the task's stack and internal state may be corrupted by concurrent modifications.

///    The definition of "priority" is left to the concrete implementation.
/// 2. The current running task.
///
/// # Interactions with OSTD
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// It is crucial for implementers of `LocalRunQueue`
/// to understand how OSTD interacts with local runqueues.
///
/// A local runqueue is consulted by OSTD in response to one of four scheduling events:
/// - **Yielding**, triggered by [`Task::yield_now`], where the current task voluntarily gives up CPU time.
/// - **Sleeping**, triggered by [`crate::sync::Waiter::wait`]
///   or any synchronization primitive built upon it (e.g., [`crate::sync::WaitQueue`], [`crate::sync::Mutex`]),
///   which blocks the current task until a wake-up event occurs.
/// - **Ticking**, triggered periodically by the system timer
///   (see [`crate::arch::timer::TIMER_FREQ`]),
///   which provides an opportunity to do time accounting and consider preemption.
/// - **Exiting**, triggered when the execution logic of a task has come to an end,
///   which informs the scheduler that the task is exiting and will never be enqueued again.
///
/// The general workflow for OSTD to handle a scheduling event is as follows:
/// 1. Acquire exclusive access to the local runqueue using [`Scheduler::mut_local_rq_with`].
/// 2. Call [`LocalRunQueue::update_current`] to update the current task's state,
///    returning a boolean value that indicates
///    whether the current task should and can be replaced with another runnable task.
/// 3. If the task is about to sleep or exit, call [`LocalRunQueue::dequeue_current`]
///    to remove it from the runqueue.
/// 4. If the return value of `update_current` in Step 2 is true,
///    then select the next task to run with [`LocalRunQueue::pick_next`].
///
/// ## When to Pick the Next Task?
///
/// As shown above,
/// OSTD guarantees that `pick_next` is only called
/// when the current task should and can be replaced.
/// This avoids unnecessary invocations and improves efficiency.
///
/// But under what conditions should the current task be replaced?
/// Two criteria must be met:
/// 1. There exists at least one other runnable task in the runqueue.
/// 2. That task should preempt the current one, if present.
///
/// Some implications of these rules:
/// - If the runqueue is empty, `update_current` must return `false`—there's nothing to run.
/// - If the runqueue is non-empty but the current task is absent,
///   `update_current` should return `true`—anything is better than nothing.
/// - If the runqueue is non-empty and the flag is `UpdateFlags::WAIT`,
///   `update_current` should also return `true`,
///   because the current task is about to block.
/// - In other cases, the return value depends on the scheduler's prioritization policy.
///   For instance, a real-time task may only be preempted by a higher-priority task
///   or if it explicitly yields.
///   A normal task under Linux's CFS may be preempted by a task with smaller vruntime,
///   but never by the idle task.
///
/// When OSTD is unsure about whether the current task should or can be replaced,
/// it will invoke [`LocalRunQueue::try_pick_next`], the fallible version of `pick_next`.
///
/// ## Internal Working

/// we provide a simplified view of how OSTD interacts with local runqueues _internally_
/// in order to handle the four scheduling events.
