//! Extensions for CPU-local types that allows single-instruction operations.
//!
//! For some per-CPU objects, fetching or modifying the values of them can be
//! done in a single instruction. Then we would avoid turning off interrupts
//! when accessing them, which incurs non-trivial overhead.
//!
//! These traits are the architecture-specific interface for single-instruction
//! operations. The architecture-specific module can implement these traits for
//! common integer types. For architectures that don't support such single-
//! instruction operations, we emulate a single-instruction implementation by
//! disabling interruptions and preemptions.
//!
//! Currently we implement some of the [`core::ops`] operations. Bitwise shift
//! implementations are missing. Also for less-fundamental types such as
//! enumerations or boolean types, the caller can cast it themselves to the
//! integer types, for which the operations are implemented.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! All operations in the provided traits are unsafe, and the caller should
//! ensure that the offset is a valid pointer to a static [`CpuLocalCell`]
//! object. The offset of the object is relative to the base address of the
//! CPU-local storage. These operations are not atomic. Accessing the same
//! address from multiple CPUs produces undefined behavior.
