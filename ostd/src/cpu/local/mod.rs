//! CPU local storage.
//!
//! This module provides a mechanism to define CPU-local objects. Users can
//! define a statically-allocated CPU-local object by the macro
//! [`crate::cpu_local!`], or allocate a dynamically-allocated CPU-local
//! object with the function [`osdk_heap_allocator::alloc_cpu_local`].
//!
//! The mechanism for statically-allocated CPU-local objects exploits the fact
//! that constant values of non-[`Copy`] types can be bitwise copied. For
//! example, a [`Option<T>`] object, though being not [`Copy`], have a constant
//! constructor [`Option::None`] that produces a value that can be bitwise
//! copied to create a new instance. [`alloc::sync::Arc`] however, don't have
//! such a constructor, and thus cannot be directly used as a statically-
//! allocated CPU-local object. Wrapping it in a type that has a constant
//! constructor, like [`Option<T>`], can make it statically-allocated CPU-local.
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! These APIs are implemented by the methods as follows:
//! 1. For statically-allocated CPU-local objects, we place them in a special
//!    section `.cpu_local`. The bootstrap processor (BSP) uses the objects
//!    linked in this section, and these objects are copied to dynamically
//!    allocated local storage of each application processors (AP) during the
//!    initialization process.
//! 2. For dynamically-allocated CPU-local objects, we prepare a fixed-size
//!    chunk for each CPU. These per-CPU memory chunks are laid out contiguously
//!    in memory in the order of the CPU IDs. A dynamically-allocated CPU-local
//!    object can be allocated by occupying the same offset in each per-CPU
//!    memory chunk.

// This module also, provide CPU-local cell objects that have inner mutability.
//
// The difference between statically-allocated CPU-local objects (defined by
// [`crate::cpu_local!`]) and CPU-local cell objects (defined by
// [`crate::cpu_local_cell!`]) is that the CPU-local objects can be shared
// across CPUs. While through a CPU-local cell object you can only access the
// value on the current CPU, therefore enabling inner mutability without locks.
