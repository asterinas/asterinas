//! CPU local storage.
//!
//! This module provides a mechanism to define CPU-local objects, by the macro
//! [`crate::cpu_local!`].
//!
//! Such a mechanism exploits the fact that constant values of non-[`Copy`]
//! types can be bitwise copied. For example, a [`Option<T>`] object, though
//! being not [`Copy`], have a constant constructor [`Option::None`] that
//! produces a value that can be bitwise copied to create a new instance.
//! [`alloc::sync::Arc`] however, don't have such a constructor, and thus cannot
//! be directly used as a CPU-local object. Wrapping it in a type that has a
//! constant constructor, like [`Option<T>`], can make it CPU-local.
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! These APIs are implemented by placing the CPU-local objects in a special
//! section `.cpu_local`. The bootstrap processor (BSP) uses the objects linked
//! in this section, and these objects are copied to dynamically allocated
//! local storage of each application processors (AP) during the initialization
//! process.

// This module also, provide CPU-local cell objects that have inner mutability.
//
// The difference between CPU-local objects (defined by [`crate::cpu_local!`])
// and CPU-local cell objects (defined by [`crate::cpu_local_cell!`]) is that
// the CPU-local objects can be shared across CPUs. While through a CPU-local
// cell object you can only access the value on the current CPU, therefore
// enabling inner mutability without locks.
//
// The cell-variant is currently not a public API because that it is rather
// hard to be used without introducing races. But it is useful for OSTD's
// internal implementation.
