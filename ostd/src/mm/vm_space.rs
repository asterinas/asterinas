/// A virtual address space for user-mode tasks, enabling safe manipulation of user-space memory.
///
/// The `VmSpace` type provides memory isolation guarantees between user-space and
/// kernel-space. For example, given an arbitrary user-space pointer, one can read and
/// write the memory location referred to by the user-space pointer without the risk of
/// breaking the memory safety of the kernel space.
///
/// # Task Association Semantics
///
/// As far as OSTD is concerned, a `VmSpace` is not necessarily associated with a task. Once a
/// `VmSpace` is activated (see [`VmSpace::activate`]), it remains activated until another
/// `VmSpace` is activated **possibly by another task running on the same CPU**.
///
/// This means that it's up to the kernel to ensure that a task's `VmSpace` is always activated
/// while the task is running. This can be done by using the injected post schedule handler
/// (see [`inject_post_schedule_handler`]) to always activate the correct `VmSpace` after each
/// context switch.
///
/// If the kernel otherwise decides not to ensure that the running task's `VmSpace` is always
/// activated, the kernel must deal with race conditions when calling methods that require the
/// `VmSpace` to be activated, e.g., [`UserMode::execute`], [`VmSpace::reader`],
/// [`VmSpace::writer`]. Otherwise, the behavior is unspecified, though it's guaranteed _not_ to
/// compromise the kernel's memory safety.
///
/// # Memory Backing
///
/// A newly-created `VmSpace` is not backed by any physical memory pages. To
/// provide memory pages for a `VmSpace`, one can allocate and map physical
/// memory ([`UFrame`]s) to the `VmSpace` using the cursor.
///
/// A `VmSpace` can also attach a page fault handler, which will be invoked to
/// handle page faults generated from user space.
