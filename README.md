## Introducing Asterinas

Asterinas is a _secure_, _fast_, and _general-purpose_ OS kernel
that provides _Linux-compatible_ ABI.
It can serve as a seamless replacement for Linux
while enhancing _memory safety_ and _developer friendliness_.

* Asterinas prioritizes memory safety
by employing Rust as its sole programming language
and limiting the use of _unsafe Rust_
to a clearly defined and minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB).
This innovative approach,
known as [the framekernel architecture](https://asterinas.github.io/book/kernel/the-framekernel-architecture.html),
establishes Asterinas as a more secure and dependable kernel option.

* Asterinas surpasses Linux in terms of developer friendliness.
It empowers kernel developers to
(1) utilize the more productive Rust programming language,
(2) leverage a purpose-built toolkit called [OSDK](https://asterinas.github.io/book/osdk/guide/index.html) to streamline their workflows,
and (3) choose between releasing their kernel modules as open source
or keeping them proprietary,
thanks to the flexibility offered by [MPL](#License).

While the journey towards a production-grade OS kernel is challenging,
we are steadfastly progressing towards this goal.
Over the course of 2024,
we significantly enhanced Asterinas's maturity,
as detailed in [our end-year report](https://asterinas.github.io/2025/01/20/asterinas-in-2024.html).
In 2025, our primary goal is to make Asterinas production-ready on x86-64 virtual machines
and attract real users!

## Getting Started

Get yourself an x86-64 Linux machine with Docker installed.
Follow the three simple steps below to get Asterinas up and running.

1. Download the latest source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asterinas/asterinas
```

2. Run a Docker container as the development environment.

```bash
docker run -it --privileged --network=host --device=/dev/kvm -v $(pwd)/asterinas:/root/asterinas asterinas/asterinas:0.14.1-20250326
```

3. Inside the container, go to the project folder to build and run Asterinas.

```bash
make build
make run
```

If everything goes well, Asterinas is now up and running inside a VM.
