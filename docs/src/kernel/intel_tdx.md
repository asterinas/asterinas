# Intel TDX

Asterinas can serve as a secure guest OS for Intel TDX-protected virtual machines (VMs).
This documentation describes
how Asterinas can be run and tested easily on a TDX-enabled Intel server.

Intel TDX (Trust Domain Extensions) is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology
that enhances VM security
by creating isolated, hardware-enforced trust domains
with encrypted memory, secure initialization, and attestation mechanisms.
For more information about Intel TDX, jump to the last section.

## Why choose Asterinas for Intel TDX

VM TEEs such as Intel TDX deserve a more secure option for its guest OS than Linux.
Linux,
with its inherent memory safety issues and large Trusted Computing Base (TCB),
has long suffered from security vulnerabilities due to memory safety bugs.
Additionally,
when Linux is used as the guest kernel inside a VM TEE,
it must process untrusted inputs
(over 1500 instances in Linux, per Intel's estimation)
from the host (via hypercalls, MMIO, and etc.).
These untrusted inputs create new attack surfaces
that can be exploited through memory safety vulnerabilities,
known as Iago attacks.

Asterinas offers greater memory safety than Linux,
particularly against Iago attacks.
Thanks to its framekernel architecture,
the memory safety of Asterinas relies solely on the Asterinas Framework,
excluding the safe device drivers built on top of the Asterinas Framework
that may handle untrusted inputs from the host.

## Prepare the Intel TDX Environment

Please make sure your server supports Intel TDX.

See [this guide](https://github.com/canonical/tdx/tree/noble-24.04?tab=readme-ov-file#4-setup-host-os)
or other materials to enable Intel TDX in host OS.

To verify the TDX host status,
you can type:

```bash
dmesg | grep "TDX module initialized"
```

The following result is an example:

```bash
[   20.507296] tdx: TDX module initialized.
```

`TDX module initialized` means TDX module is loaded successfully.

## Build and run Asterinas

1. Download the latest source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asterinas/asterinas
```

2. Run a Docker container as the development environment.

```bash
docker run -it --privileged --network=host --device=/dev/kvm -v $(pwd)/asterinas:/root/asterinas asterinas/asterinas:0.9.0-tdx
```

3. Inside the container,
go to the project folder to build and run Asterinas.

```bash
make run INTEL_TDX=1
```

If everything goes well,
Asterinas is now up and running inside a TDVM.

## About Intel TDX

Intel® Trust Domain Extensions (Intel® TDX)
is Intel's newest confidential computing technology.
This hardware-based trusted execution environment (TEE)
facilitates the deployment of trust domains (TD),
which are hardware-isolated virtual machines (VM) designed to
protect sensitive data and applications from unauthorized access.

A CPU-measured Intel TDX module enables Intel TDX.
This software module runs in a new CPU Secure Arbitration Mode (SEAM)
as a peer virtual machine manager (VMM),
and supports TD entry and exit
using the existing virtualization infrastructure.
The module is hosted in a reserved memory space
identified by the SEAM Range Register (SEAMRR).

Intel TDX uses hardware extensions for managing and encrypting memory
and protects both the confidentiality and integrity
of the TD CPU state from non-SEAM mode.

Intel TDX uses architectural elements such as SEAM,
a shared bit in Guest Physical Address (GPA),
secure Extended Page Table (EPT),
physical-address-metadata table,
Intel® Total Memory Encryption – Multi-Key (Intel® TME-MK),
and remote attestation.

Intel TDX ensures data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity,
which empowers engineers and tech professionals
to create and maintain secure systems,
enhancing trust in virtualized environments.
