# Asterinas Kernel

## Overview

Asterinas is a _secure_, _fast_, and _general-purpose_ OS kernel
that provides an _Linux-compatible_ ABI.
It can serve as a seamless replacement for Linux
while enhancing _memory safety_ and _developer friendliness_.

* Asterinas prioritizes memory safety
by employing Rust as its sole programming language
and limiting the use of _unsafe Rust_
to a clearly defined and minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB).
This innovative approach,
known as [the framekernel architecture](the-framekernel-architecture.md),
establishes Asterinas as a more secure and dependable kernel option.

* Asterinas surpasses Linux in terms of developer friendliness.
It empowers kernel developers to
(1) utilize the more productive Rust programming language,
(2) leverage a purpose-built toolkit called [OSDK]() to streamline their workflows,
and (3) choose between releasing their kernel modules as open source
or keeping them proprietary,
thanks to the flexibility offered by [MPL](../).

While the journey towards a production-grade OS kernel can be challenging,
we are steadfastly progressing towards our goal.
Currently, Asterinas only supports x86-64 VMs.
However, [our aim for 2024](roadmap.md) is
to make Asterinas production-ready on x86-64
for both bare-metal and VM environments.

## Getting Started

Get yourself an x86-64 Linux machine with Docker installed.
Follow the three simple steps below to get Asterinas up and running.

1. Download the latest source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asterinas/asterinas
```

2. Run a Docker container as the development environment.

```bash
docker run -it --privileged \
               --network=host \
               --device=/dev/kvm \
               -v $(pwd)/asterinas:/root/asterinas \
               asterinas/asterinas:0.9.0
```

3. Inside the container, go to the project folder to build and run Asterinas.

```bash
make build
make run
```

If everything goes well, Asterinas is now up and running inside a VM.
