# Asterinas Documentation

The documentation is rendered as a book with [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/),
which can be installed with `cargo`.

```bash
cargo install mdbook
```

To build the book and read it in your default browser, run the following command.

```bash
mdbook serve --open
```
