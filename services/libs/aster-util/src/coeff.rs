//! This module provides an abstraction `Coeff` to server for efficient and accurate calculation
//! of fraction multiplication.

/// A `Coeff` is used to do a fraction multiplication operation with an unsigned integer.
/// It can achieve accurate and efficient calculation and avoid numeric overflow at the same time.
///
/// # Example
///
/// Let's say we want to multiply a fraction (23456 / 56789) with the target integer `a`,
/// which will be no larger than `1_000_000_000`, we can use the following code snippets
/// to get an accurate result.
///
/// ```
/// let a = input();
/// let coeff = Coeff::new(23456, 56789, 1_000_000_000);
/// let result = coeff * a;
/// ```
///
/// # How it works
/// `Coeff` is used in the calculation of a fraction value multiplied by an integer.
/// Here is a simple example of such calculation:
///
/// ```rust
/// let result = (a / b) * c;
/// ```
///
/// In this equation, `a`, `b`, `c` and `result` are all integers. To acquire a more precise result, we will
/// generally calculate `a * c` first and then divide the multiplication result with `b`.
/// However, this simple calculation above has two complications:
/// - The calculation of `a * c` may overflow if they are too large.
/// - The division operation is much more expensive than integer multiplication, which can easily create performance bottlenecks.
///
/// `Coeff` is implemented to address these two issues. It can be used to replace the fraction in this calculation.
/// For example, a `Coeff` generated from (a / b) can modify the calculation above to ensure that:
///
/// ```
/// coeff * c ~= (a / b) * c
/// ```
///
/// In principle, `Coeff` actually turns the multiplication and division into a combination of multiplication and bit operation.
/// When creating a `Coeff`, it needs to know the numerator and denominator of the represented fraction
/// and the max multiplier it will be multiplied by. Then, a `mult` and a `shift` will be chosen to achieve the replacement of calculation.
/// Taking the previous calculation as an example again, `coeff * c` will turn into `mult * c >> shift`, ensuring that:
///
/// ```
/// mult * c >> shift ~= (a / b) * c
/// ```
///
/// and
///  
/// `mult * c` will not result in numeric overflow (i.e., `mult * c` will stay below MAX_U64).
///
/// This is how `Coeff` achieves accuracy and efficiency at the same time.
