//! This module provides abstractions for hardware-assisted timing mechanisms, encapsulated by the `ClockSource` struct.
//! A `ClockSource` can be constructed from any counter with a stable frequency, enabling precise time measurements to be taken
//! by retrieving instances of `Instant`.
//!
//! The `ClockSource` module is a fundamental building block for timing in systems that require high precision and accuracy.
//! It can be integrated into larger systems to provide timing capabilities, or used standalone for time tracking and elapsed time measurements.

/// `ClockSource` is an abstraction for hardware-assisted timing mechanisms.
/// A `ClockSource` can be created based on any counter that operates at a stable frequency.
/// Users are able to measure time by retrieving `Instant` from this source.
///
/// # Implementation
/// The `ClockSource` relies on obtaining the frequency of the counter and the method for reading the cycles in order to measure time.
/// The **cycles** here refer the counts of the base time counter.
/// Additionally, the `ClockSource` also holds a last recorded instant, which acts as a reference point for subsequent time retrieval.
/// To prevent numerical overflow during the calculation of `Instant`, this last recorded instant **must be periodically refreshed**.
/// The maximum interval for these updates must be determined at the time of the `ClockSource` initialization.
///
/// # Examples
/// Suppose we have a counter called `counter` which have the frequency `counter.freq`, and the method to read its cycles called `read_counter()`.
/// We can create a corresponding `ClockSource` and use it as follows:
///
/// ```rust
/// // here we set the max_delay_secs = 10
/// let max_delay_secs = 10;
/// // create a clocksource named counter_clock
/// let counter_clock = ClockSource::new(counter.freq, max_delay_secs, Arc::new(read_counter));
/// // read an instant.
/// let instant = counter_clock.read_instant();
/// ```
///
/// If using this `ClockSource`, you must ensure its internal instant will be updated
/// at least once within a time interval of not more than `max_delay_secs.
