## Mount and Unmount File Systems

### `mount`

Supported functionality in SCML:

```c
// Create a new mount
mount(
    source, target, filesystemtype,
    mountflags = 0,
    data
);

// Move the existing mount point
mount(
    source, target, filesystemtype,
    mountflags = MS_MOVE,
    data
);

// Create a bind mount
mount(
    source, target, filesystemtype,
    mountflags = MS_BIND | MS_REC,
    data
);
```

Partially supported mount flags:
* `MS_REC` is only effective when used in conjunction with `MS_BIND`
* `MS_REMOUNT` can be used, but the set options have no actual effect.
* `MS_DIRSYNC` can be set but have no atual effect.
* `MS_LAZYTIME` can be set but have no atual effect.
* `MS_MANDLOCK` can be set but have no atual effect.
* `MS_NOATIME` can be set but have no atual effect.
* `MS_NODEV` can be set but have no atual effect.
* `MS_NODIRATIME` can be set but have no atual effect.
* `MS_NOEXEC` can be set but have no atual effect.
* `MS_NOSUID` can be set but have no atual effect.
* `MS_RDONLY` can be set but have no atual effect.
* `MS_RELATIME` can be set but have no atual effect.
* `MS_SILENT` can be set but have no atual effect.
* `MS_STRICTATIME` can be set but have no atual effect.
* `MS_SYNCHRONOUS` can be set but have no atual effect.

Unsupported mount flags:
* `MS_SHARED`
* `MS_PRIVATE`
* `MS_SLAVE`

### `umount` and `umount2`

Supported functionality in SCML:

```c
// Unmount a mounted file system
umount(target);

// Unmount a mounted file system with enhanced behavior control
umount2(target, flags = UMOUNT_NOFOLLOW);
```

Silently-ignored flags:
* `MNT_FORCE`
* `MNT_DETACH`
* `MNT_EXPIRE`
