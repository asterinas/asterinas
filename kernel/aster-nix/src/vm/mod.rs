//! Virtual memory (VM).
//!
//! There are two primary VM abstractions:
//! * Virtual Memory Address Regions (VMARs) a type of capability that manages
//! user address spaces.
//! * Virtual Memory Objects (VMOs) are are a type of capability that
//! represents a set of memory pages.
//!
//! The concepts of VMARs and VMOs are originally introduced by
//! [Zircon](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/reference/kernel_objects/vm_object).
//! As capabilities, the two abstractions are aligned with our goal
//! of everything-is-a-capability, although their specifications and
//! implementations in C/C++ cannot apply directly to Asterinas.
//! In Asterinas, VMARs and VMOs, as well as other capabilities, are implemented
//! as zero-cost capabilities.
