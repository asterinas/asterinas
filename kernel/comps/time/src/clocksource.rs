//! The `ClockSource` module is a fundamental building block for timing in systems that require

/// `ClockSource` is an abstraction for hardware-assisted timing mechanisms.
/// A `ClockSource` can be created based on any counter that operates at a stable frequency.
/// Users are able to measure time by retrieving `Instant` from this source.
///
/// # Implementation
/// The `ClockSource` relies on obtaining the frequency of the counter and the method for
/// reading the cycles in order to measure time.
///
/// The **cycles** here refer the counts of the base time counter.
///
/// Additionally, the `ClockSource` also holds a last record for an `Instant` and the
/// corresponding cycles, which acts as a reference point for subsequent time retrieval.
/// To prevent numerical overflow during  the calculation of `Instant`, this last recorded instant
/// **must be periodically refreshed**. The maximum interval for these updates must be determined
/// at the time of the `ClockSource` initialization.
///
/// # Examples
/// Suppose we have a counter called `counter` which have the frequency `counter.freq`, and the method
/// to read its cycles called `read_counter()`. We can create a corresponding `ClockSource` and
/// use it as follows:
///
/// ```rust
/// // here we set the max_delay_secs = 10
/// let max_delay_secs = 10;
/// // create a clocksource named counter_clock
/// let counter_clock = ClockSource::new(counter.freq, max_delay_secs, Arc::new(read_counter));
/// // read an instant.
/// let instant = counter_clock.read_instant();
/// ```
///
/// If using this `ClockSource`, you must ensure its internal instant will be updated
/// at least once within a time interval of not more than `max_delay_secs.
