/// Safe pointers.
///
/// # Overview
///
/// Safe pointers allows using pointers to access memory without
/// unsafe code, which is a key enabler for writing device drivers in safe Rust.
///
/// To ensure its soundness, safe pointers (`SafePtr<T, M, _>`) have to be
/// more restricted than raw pointers (`*const T` or `*mut T`).
/// More specifically, there are three major restrictions.
///
/// 1. A safe pointer can only refer to a value of a POD type `T: Pod`,
///    while raw pointers can do to a value of any type `T`.
/// 2. A safe pointer can only refer to an address within a virtual memory object
///    of type `M: VmIo` (e.g., VMAR and VMO), while raw pointers can do to
///    an address within any virtual memory space.
/// 3. A safe pointer only allows one to copy values to/from the target address,
///    while a raw pointer allows one to borrow an immutable or mutable reference
///    to the target address.
///
/// The expressiveness of safe pointers, although being less than that of
/// raw pointers, is sufficient for our purpose of writing an OS kernel in safe
/// Rust.
///
/// In addition, safe pointers `SafePtr<T, M, R>` are associated with access
/// rights, which are encoded statically with type `R: TRights`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Constructing a safe pointer
///
/// An instance of `SafePtr` can be created with a VM object and an address
/// within the VM object.
///
/// ```
/// let u32_ptr: SafePtr<u32, Vec<u8>, _> = {
///     let vm_obj = VmoOptions::new(PAGE_SIZE).alloc().unwrap();
///     let addr = 16;
///     SafePtr::new(vm_obj, addr)
/// };
/// ```
///
/// The generic parameter `M` of `SafePtr<_, M, _>` must implement the `VmIo`
/// trait. The most important `VmIo` types are `Vmar`, `Vmo`, `IoMem`, and
/// `Frame`. The blanket implementations of `VmIo` also include pointer-like
/// types that refer to a `VmIo` type. Some examples are `&Vmo`, `Box<Vmar>`,
/// and `Arc<IoMem>`.
///
/// The safe pointer itself does not and cannot guarantee that its address is valid.
/// This is because different VM objects may interpret addresses differently
/// and each VM object can have different restrictions for valid addresses.
/// So the detection of invalid addresses is delayed to the time when the
/// pointers are actually read from or written to.
///
/// Initially, a newly-created safe pointer has all access rights.
///
/// ## Reading and writing a safe pointer
///
/// The value pointed to by a safe pointer can be read or written with the
/// `read` or `write` method. Both methods may return errors. The possible reasons
/// of error are determined by the underlying VM objects.
///
/// ```
/// u32_ptr.write(1234).unwrap();
/// assert!(u32_ptr.read().unwrap() == 1234);
/// ```
///
/// ## Manipulating a safe pointer
///
/// The address of a safe pointer can be obtained by the `addr` method.
/// The address can be updated by assigning a new value with the `set_addr` method
/// or updated incrementally through methods like `add`, `offset`, `byte_addr`,
/// `byte_offset`.
///  
/// The VM object of a safe pointer can also be obtained or updated through the
/// `vm` and `set_vm` methods. A new safe pointer that is backed by the same
/// VM object of an existing safe pointer can be obtained through the `borrow_vm`
/// method.
///
/// As an example, the code below shows how the `add` and `borrow_vm` methods
/// can be used together to to iterate all values pointed to by an array pointer.
///
/// ```
/// fn collect_values<T>(array_ptr: &SafePtr<T, M, _>, array_len: usize) -> Vec<T> {
///     let mut curr_ptr: SafePtr<T, &M, _> = array_ptr.borrow_vm();
///     (0..array_len)
///         .iter()
///         .map(|_| {
///             let val = curr_ptr.read().unwrap();
///             curr_ptr.add(1);
///             val
///         })
///         .collect()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The data type of a safe pointer can be converted with the `cast` method.
///
/// ```rust
/// let u8_ptr: SafePtr<u8, _, _> = u32_ptr.cast();
/// ```
///
/// ## Reading and writing the fields of a struct
///
/// Given a safe pointer that points to a struct (say, `Foo`), one can read
/// the value of its field as follows.
///
/// ```
/// pub struct Foo {
///     first: u64,
///     second: u32,
/// }
///
/// fn read_second_field<M: VmIo>(ptr: &SafePtr<Foo, M, _>) -> u32 {
///     let field_ptr = ptr
///         .borrow_vm()
///         .byte_add(offset_of!(Foo, second) as usize)
///         .cast::<u32>();
///     field_ptr.read().unwrap()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// But this coding pattern is too tedius for such a common task.
/// To make the life of users easier, we provide a convenient macro named
/// `field_ptr`, which can be used to obtain the safe pointer of a field from
/// that of its containing struct.
///
/// ```
/// fn read_second_field<M: VmIo>(ptr: &SafePtr<Foo, M, _>) -> u32 {
///     let field_ptr = field_ptr!(ptr, Foo, second);
///     field_ptr.read().unwrap()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Access rights
///
/// A safe pointer may have a combination of three access rights:
/// Read, Write, and Dup.
